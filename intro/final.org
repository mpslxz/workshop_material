* What
One of the riddles that basically divided the internet was the one that was posted on People's Daily China twitter account ([[https://twitter.com/PDChina/status/806615066133090308/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%255Etfw&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%252Fnews%252F2016%252F12%252F08%252Fmany-triangles-can-see-puzzle-divides-internet%252F][Click here to see the post]]).
It simply asks how many triangles are in the following image:
[[./final.jpeg]]

For the final project of the workshop, write a function in python and OpenCV that returns the number of triangles in this image. You can use any computer vision algorithm that you wish.

* How
Your function should have the following prototype:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def count_triangles(image):
count = 0
...
return count 
#+END_SRC

Save your function in a file called 'solution.py' and put it in a zip file along with your document.
Send your zip file to mehranp@ece.ubc.ca
